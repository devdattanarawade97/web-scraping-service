#### **The Problem to Be Solved in Your Own Words**
We need a service where users can submit a URL via an API and receive a summary of the webpage's textual content. The process involves:
1. Scraping the textual content of the provided URL.
2. Sending the scraped content to an external LLM for summarization.
3. Storing the results or error messages in a database.
4. Providing mechanisms for users to fetch the results programmatically.

This solution should handle errors gracefully and ensure the system's responsiveness for job submissions and result retrieval.

---

#### **Technical Specification of the Design**

1. **API Design**
   - **POST Endpoint**: Accepts a URL, initiates a scraping and summarization job, and returns a job ID with a `pending` status.
   - **GET Endpoint**: Allows users to fetch the job results using the job ID, returning either a summary or an error message.

2. **System Workflow**
   - A user submits a URL to the POST endpoint.
   - The service processes the job asynchronously:
     - Scrapes the webpage for text.
     - Sends the text to an external LLM (e.g., OpenAI or Cohere AI) for summarization.
     - Stores the summary or error details in MongoDB.
   - Users retrieve the results via the GET endpoint.

3. **Components**
   - **Web Scraper**: Puppeteer is used to fetch text content from both static and dynamic web pages.
   - **LLM Integration**: An external LLM API is used to generate concise summaries.
   - **Database**: MongoDB stores job details, summaries, and error messages, chosen for its scalability and rich querying capabilities.
   - **Queue**: Asynchronous processing ensures non-blocking API operations.

---

#### **Technical Decisions and Justifications**

1. **Node.js**: Ideal for asynchronous operations, especially for tasks like scraping and API integration.
2. **Puppeteer**: Reliable for web scraping, especially for modern JavaScript-driven websites.
3. **MongoDB**:
   - Chosen over SQLite for its scalability and ability to handle large datasets effectively.
   - Provides flexibility in managing and querying job data.
4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Currently using OpenAI for simplicity and quality.
   - For production, Cohere AI is recommended due to its scalability and ability to handle high request volumes.
5. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Improves API responsiveness by decoupling job submission from processing.

#### **How the Solution Achieves the Adminâ€™s Desired Outcome**

The system delivers:
1. **Efficient Job Management**: Users can submit URLs and receive job IDs instantly.
2. **Summary Generation**: Integrates with LLM APIs for accurate and concise summaries.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensures that errors are logged and returned via the API.
4. **Result Retrieval**: Provides a seamless way for users to access results programmatically.

The design is modular, focusing on meeting core functional requirements while leaving room for enhancements.

---

#### **Limitations of the PoC and Production-Readiness Recommendations**

1. **LLM Scalability**:
   - **Current Limitation**: OpenAI API might not handle high workloads efficiently or cost-effectively.
   - **Solution**: Integrate Cohere AI or deploy an open-source model fine-tuned for summarization tasks.

2. **Database Scalability**:
   - MongoDB is already scalable, but proper indexing and clustering are required to handle high data volumes efficiently.

3. **Security**:
   - Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2).
   - Add input validation and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

4. **Queue Management**:
   - Introduce distributed queue systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka for fault-tolerant job processing.

5. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track performance and detect issues.
   - Use centralized logging with tools like Logstash or Elastic Stack.

6. **Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for all components.
   - Create integration tests to validate the system's end-to-end functionality.

#### **Thought Process and Approach**

1. **Problem Breakdown**:
   - Identified core functionalities: job submission, text scraping, summarization, result storage, and retrieval.

2. **Prioritization**:
   - Focused on delivering a working PoC with essential features first.

3. **Scalability Planning**:
   - Considered production-level requirements, documented limitations, and outlined solutions.

4. **Decision Rationale**:
   - Chose tools and libraries that are reliable, well-documented, and suited for scaling as needed.

### API Documentation and cURL Command Guide

This document serves as a guide for understanding and testing the APIs in your project. It includes detailed descriptions of each endpoint, expected responses, and cURL commands to interact with the API.

---

#### Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

---

### API Endpoints

#### 1. **Create a Job**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /jobs`
   - **Description**: Creates a new job for scraping and summarizing a URL.
   - **Request Headers**:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "url": "https://example.com"
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - **201 Created**
     - Example:
       ```json
       {
         "id": "675111d2f13f4228801f8631",
         "url": "https://example.com",
         "status": "pending"
       }
       ```

   - **cURL Command**:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/jobs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
     ```

---

#### 2. **Retrieve a Job**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /jobs/{id}`
   - **Description**: Retrieves the status and details of a specific job by its ID.
   - **Path Parameter**:
     - `id`: The ID of the job to retrieve.
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**
     - Example:
       ```json
       {
         "id": "675111d2f13f4228801f8631",
         "url": "https://example.com",
         "status": "completed",
         "summary": "This is the summary of the webpage."
       }
       ```

   - **cURL Command**:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/675111d2f13f4228801f8631
     ```

### Notes for Developers
1. **Testing with cURL**:
   - Ensure the server is running locally on `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Replace `{id}` in the cURL commands with actual job IDs returned by the `POST` or `GET /jobs` endpoints.

2. **Handling Responses**:
   - The `status` field in job details can be:
     - `pending`: The job is still being processed.
     - `completed`: The job has been processed, and a summary is available.
     - `failed`: An error occurred during processing.

3. **Error Responses**:
   - **404 Not Found**: Returned if a job with the specified ID does not exist.
   - **400 Bad Request**: Returned for invalid input data.

### Example Workflow Using cURL
1. **Create a Job**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/jobs \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
   ```
   Response:

   curl http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/675111d2f13f4228801f8631
   ```
   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "675111d2f13f4228801f8631",
     "url": "https://example.com",
     "status": "completed",
     "summary": "This is the summary of the webpage."
   }
   ```
